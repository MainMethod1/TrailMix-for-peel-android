Many memorial trees have been planted in the park.\n\nThe entire trail is in the community of Meadowvale, sometimes called Meadowvale West to distinguish it from the old Meadowvale Village.\n\nMost of Meadowvale was developed in the 1970s as a master-planned area and promoted as a \"New Town in the Country.\" Many of the names, including Aquitaine (a historical region of south western France), were borrowed from other countries in an effort to give the places a romantic and lyrical character.\n\nMost of the trail is on the former Weylie (Wylie) Farm.

It meets the Lake Aquitaine Trail at Battleford Rd.\n\nIt's other end, west of Lake Wabukayne, joins Winston Churchill Boulevard and the trail that bears that name.\n\nCreaed in 1976 as a storm water management facility, Lake Wabukayne replaced the Cook farm pond. To develop the lake, damming took place on a natural creek, also called Wabukayne.\n\nSome old stands of oak, willow, beech and maple trees can be found near the trail. The eastern milk snake, a \"species of concern\" that is considered rare in the province, has been observed here.\n\nIn total, there are an estimated 49 plant and 16 animal species in this area.\n\nThe name \"Wabukayne,\" meaning \"White Snow,\" is associated with two Mississauga First Nation (Anishnabe) leaders. Chief Wabukayne was one of the representatives who signed the Toronto Purchase in 1787 and the Mississauga Purchase in 1805. Another chief, Wabakinine, headed the Eagle clan, Mississaugas of the Credit. He and his wife died on August 20, 1796, following a violent assault by a British soldier.

It provides a scenic connection to the many schools and parks in the area.\n\nMany early pioneer families settled in the area that is now traversed by the trail (Carneys, Cordingleys, Masons, Mays, McCarrons, McGregors, Millers and Orrs) and would have been members of what was called the �Town Line Blazers.�\n\nAt Derry Rd. and Winston Churchill Boulevard, was the pioneer community of Lisgar (Switzer�s Corners), from which the modern area takes its name.\n\nAt the southwest corner of Derry Rd. and the 16 Mile Creek tributary is the pioneer Kindree Cemetery. Near the intersection of the trail and Britannia Rd. once stood an early pioneer school, S.S. #10 Trafalgar.\n\nThe Lisgar area was incorporated into Mississauga in 1974 through the extension of Mississauga�s western boundary. The majority of development along the trail took place in the 1980s and 1990s, with some of the older woodlots remaining.\n\nCommon trees found in the surrounding area are silver maple, red ash, willow, bur oak and a remnant of a shagbark hickory forest.\n\nNesting boxes have been placed along a portion of the trail in an effort to re-establish the eastern bluebird and purple martin. Other species include northern cardinal and mourning dove.\n",

The name of the creek itself provides a valuable link to our past, referencing a vital pioneer industry once located along its banks.\n\nSome simple actions you can undertake around your home to improve the health of the Sawmill Creek watershed include planting species native to Ontario, directing your roof downspouts onto grassed areas or into rain-barrels, and not using storm drains to discard waste products.\n\nAs you make your way along the Sawmill Creek Trail and watershed area, please help to protect and preserve this natural area for everyone�s enjoyment.",
